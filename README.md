## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. My assignment this week was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I've created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. I've providede the link to my tutorial below

## Mock-Up

The following video shows an example of the application being used from the command line:
